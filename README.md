# üß¨ Simple Genetic Algorithm and Applications

## üìå Project Overview
I developed this project with 10 group members for one of my courses. 

It implements a Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) to mimic evolutionary processes like natural selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism to solve optimization problems using different objective functions. The implementation includes three benchmark functions and two custom functions provided by our professor.

## üß† Features:
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust population size, mutation rate, and generations.
- **Objective Function Selection:** Includes Sphere, Rosenbrock, and Himmelblau functions + custom functions.
- **Visualization:** Plots the convergence of the algorithm using Matplotlib.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built using Tkinter for ease of use.
